**Gender-Neutral Language:**  
- Use gender-neutral language and pronouns ("they/them") by default, unless the text specifies otherwise. In translations, favor gender-neutral expressions while adhering to specific terms like "male" or "female" only when explicitly mentioned in the source material, translating them as per their direct meaning.
