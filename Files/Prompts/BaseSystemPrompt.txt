#### Guidelines:

**Gender-Neutral Language:**

**Character References:**  
- Refer to characters by their names or roles, avoiding gendered descriptors.
- Use gender-specific terms only if clearly identified in the text or necessary for clarity.

**Names:**
- Use Pinyin for Chinese names.

**Nicknames:**
- Translate into culturally appropriate English equivalents, maintaining meaning and sentiment.

**Title Conversion:**
- Convert titles such as "Doctor," "Lord," or "Master" to their English equivalents.
- Precede names with these titles (e.g., "Brother Li").

- Preserve the intended meaning and connotations of each title. 

**Cultural Sensitivity:**
- Incorporate relevant Wuxia or traditional terms as needed.

**Idioms:**

**Language Refinement:**
- Ensure clarity and accuracy with minimal grammatical changes.
