Consequently, all three kingdoms—Xia, Jin, and Zhou—sought to bring Tianji Ge under their sway. Just as everyone was curious about which side Tianji Ge would support, it was announced that Tianji Ge had relocated above the Great River, operating independently from the Three Kingdoms and other sects, and had renamed itself Evernight Capital due to its independence from the Three Kingdoms.#22#0#

Consequently, he specifically established Songshi Mountain. Following this, Master Weicheng arrived at Songshi Mountain to gather disciples and impart Bodhi's teachings, instructing them in martial arts unique to Songshi Mountain. Because the Emperor of Wei honored the lineage of Bodhi, decrees were enacted such that all Bodhi disciples would be exempt from taxes. This led to a surge in temple construction within Wei territories, with many commoners joining Bodhi's sect. As a result, the tradition of Bodhi reached its zenith.

The elder and others accepted the Salo lineage and journeyed far westward to establish Great Snow Mountain, where they chose individuals for teaching. Descendants of Great Snow Mountain were forbidden from learning or demonstrating teachings without initiation or direct transmission. This contributed to its mystique. Due to its mysterious location and remoteness, as well as a lack of interest in participating in the disputes among schools, Great Snow Mountain managed to preserve itself intact despite the fierce struggles for dominance among schools within Inner China.#27#0#

During the reign of Emperor Jiahe over the Yan Kingdom, he greatly esteemed the Imperial Void Gate's alchemical methods, allowing many of its disciples to enter the palace and refine elixirs for him. At that time, the Imperial Void Gate was arguably at the pinnacle of renown within the realm. However, after Duke Chengjun's reform efforts, numerous disciples were accused of treason and imprisoned, causing severe losses with many texts being sealed away. The former glory could no longer be recovered.#35#0#
40022#Distant Snow Peak#4#0#0#Distant Snow Peak#A sect that distances itself from conflict and worldly affairs, dedicated solely to the pursuit of martial excellence at its peak, practices in the remote snow-covered mountains where snow never melts. The harsh coldness of their environment is reflected in their sword art, which exudes a chilling sharpness. Few disciples of this sect venture into the Jianghu, but should any of them die outside, Distant Snow Peak will send someone to retrieve and enshrine their swords in the Sword Tomb, offering a final resting place for their spirits at their martial home. Thus, many extraordinary tales are interred within the Sword Tomb.#36#0#
40023#Suhai Sect#4#0#0#Suhai Sect#On the Jianghu, a new rising sect has emerged along the coastal areas. From their deep contemplation of the vast seas, they have developed a unique style of martial arts characterized by an adeptness in knife technique. Their approach is expansive and dynamic, capable of breaking through anything with great presence and force. The teachings of the sect emphasize these skills: Gratitude must be repaid, and grudges must be settled. Hence, the disciple is often entangled in various matters of Jianghu gratitude and vengeance.#37#0#
40027#Pine Brushing Gate#4#0#0#Pine Brushing Gate#Located on a mountain in the northern region of the Xia Kingdom, this school may not compare with the most prestigious and powerful martial arts sects within Jianghu. However, due to its adherence to the harmonious blend of toughness and flexibility in martial arts, as well as its noble spirit, it has gained considerable renown in Jianghu. The mountain where Pine Brushing Gate is situated is home to many lush, resilient pines, which may have influenced the school's philosophy. Whether instructing disciples in martial arts or teaching them how to live their lives, Pine Brushing Gate emphasizes the importance of being as upright and tough as pine trees, maintaining a stance of dignity without arrogance or humility.#38#0#
40028#Ridge Flower Valley#4#0#0#Ridge Flower Valley#Located in the valley of North Mountain, this sect is not fond of participating in Jianghu conflicts but encourages its disciples within the valley to use their skills for the good of others and provide medical aid.

40031#Sword Breaker Gate of the Mad Blade#4#0#0#Sword Breaker Gate of the Mad Blade#The Wild Blade Sect and Sword Breaker Gate trace their origins back to ancient times, with years too numerous to count. Though they share the same roots, a rift led them to part ways. The leader of the Wild Blade Sect, Xu Hongxuan, once implemented the Six Secrets taught by Shi Aohan, which shook the Jianghu with his might. The Sword Breaker Gate treasures an invaluable artifact, the Juechen Sword, held by their sect leader—a sword that leaves no trace in the dust and casts a thousand shadowless reflections. After centuries of contention, the Wild Blade Sect and Sword Breaker Gate put aside their differences, transforming swords into silk, and united as one sect.#30#4003101#

The current sect leader is Xu Hongxian, who practices the Haohan Six Techniques and was once renowned throughout Jianghu. The disciples of the sect possess heroic hearts and courageous spirits, wielding their swords across the lands solely to restore the renown of Wild Blade. As the clouds gather in Jianghu, Wild Blade awaits its unveiling. The Wild Blade Sect is located atop the grand peaks of Xionghun Mountain, with towering peaks that seem to reach the sky. At dusk, when the sun sinks and golden light spills down, the knife peak stands cold and majestic, rivaling heaven itself. Harsh winds whip up, stirring mists into tumultuous waves akin to war drums beating. On this mountain, bizarre boulders loom, yet among them stand proud pine trees that resemble the fierce courage of Wild Blade's many heroes. As the pine branches sway gently in the wind, they seem to hum ancient battle songs. This place shows no signs of soft beauty but possesses a grandeur all its own. It is truly a domain where Wulin warriors roam freely and boldly.#10#4004701#
