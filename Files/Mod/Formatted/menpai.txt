In this chaotic era, Dukuo Zhan established Tianjige to carve out a niche for himself by gathering intelligence from various countries and factions. Over time, after hundreds of years of refinement, when the Three Kingdoms standoff finally materialized, Tianjige became the largest Jianghu sect and the central hub for intelligence across the world. Consequently, all three nations—Xia, Jin, and Zhou—were keen to bring Tianjige under their control. Just as everyone was curious about which faction Tianjige would support, news spread that Tianjige had relocated to the banks of the Great River, becoming independent from the Three Kingdoms and other factions, and renamed itself Evernight Capital due to its newfound independence.#Almighty#0|1|2|3|4#3003#

After Bai Wenqing's passing, Zhang Sigu established the sect to protect common people affected by war within Yan State, quickly attracting numerous disciples and becoming one of the earliest sects in the region. It witnessed the unifications among the Seven States and the zenith of Wei, Qi, and Chu. Later, with Emperor Jiahe's veneration for Xuanmen, the sect's disciples gained access to circles of royal nobility and were even involved in aristocratic disputes. Many noble families sent their children to train in the Primordial Sword Sect, elevating it to a leading position among the Xuanmen.#Sword#1|2#3002#

In honor of his disciples from across the land, he specifically built Songshi Mountain. Subsequently, Master Weicheng arrived at Songshi Mountain to gather numerous disciples, imparting the teachings of Bodhi and instructing in martial arts specific to Songshi Mountain. Due to Emperor Wei's veneration of Bodhi's lineage, regulations were enacted allowing all Bodhi disciples exemption from taxes. This led to a surge in temple construction throughout Wei territory, with many commoners joining the Bodhi tradition. Bodhi reached its peak during this time. As the most representative sect of Bodhi, Songshi Mountain developed extensively and flourished, with disciples scattered across every corner of Wei#Combat, long-range weapons#1|2#3001#

Even after founding his faction, Master Ziyu continued to uphold the central philosophy of the Academy, which is benevolence. He sent many disciples out to teach, broadening recruitment efforts. Within the faction, there was no class distinction; thus, numerous scholars from humble backgrounds were able to enroll and subsequently enter officialdom to realize their ambitions.

While his long sword could drive off nefarious troublemakers, it was powerless in healing those wounded or afflicted by serious illness. Consequently, after these experiences, Chi Xunjian not only continued to refine his swordsmanship but also devoted considerable effort to researching alchemy and formulating elixirs.

However, the elder law guardian of Songshi Mountain disagreed with contemporary leaders on the matter of Bodhi transmission, leading to his departure from Songshi Mountain in search of a new path. Coincidentally, at this time, the Saro school entered the inner regions. The elder law guardians and others accepted the Saro teachings and traveled westward to establish Great Snow Mountain, selecting disciples for instruction. Practitioners of the Great Snow Mountain lineage were not allowed to teach or demonstrate techniques to others without formal initiation or transmission. This created an aura of mystery around them. Due to its mysterious location in a remote area and its lack of interest in participating in factional disputes, Great Snow Mountain managed to preserve itself intact regardless of how brutal the conflicts among other schools within the inner regions became.#Combat, long-range weapons#1|2#3003#
