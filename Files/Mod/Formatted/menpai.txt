Dugu Zhan, amidst this chaotic world, founded Tianji Ge to carve out a niche for himself by collecting intelligence from various nations and sects. This allowed him to establish his own power base during the chaos. After several hundred years of refinement, the Three States' standoff came into being, and Tianji Ge became the largest Jianghu Sect and the greatest gathering place of information in all under heaven. Consequently, all three states—Xia, Jin, and Zhou—sought to bring Tianji Ge under their control. At a time when everyone was curious about which power Tianji Ge would ultimately support, news broke that Tianji Ge had moved its base to the upper reaches of the Great River, declaring independence from the Three States and all sects, and renamed itself as the Evernight Capital due to its independence from the Three States.#Almighty#0|1|2|3|4#3003#

Within the Yan Kingdom, it quickly attracted many disciples and became one of the earliest sects to emerge there, witnessing the annexations between the Seven States and the zenith of Wei, Qi, and Chu. Later, as Emperor Jiahe revered the Immortals, disciples of the Primordial Sword Sect were able to travel among noble families and even participate in some aristocratic struggles. Many noble households sent their children to study at the Primordial Sword Sect, leading it gradually to become the foremost sect within the realm of the Immortals.#Sword#1|2#3002#

In honor of his disciples from across the land, he specifically built Songshi Mountain. Subsequently, Master Weicheng arrived at Songshi Mountain to gather numerous disciples, imparting the teachings of Bodhi and instructing in martial arts specific to Songshi Mountain. Due to Emperor Wei's veneration of Bodhi's lineage, regulations were enacted allowing all Bodhi disciples exemption from taxes. This led to a surge in temple construction throughout Wei territory, with many commoners joining the Bodhi tradition. Bodhi reached its peak during this time. As the most representative sect of Bodhi, Songshi Mountain developed extensively and flourished, with disciples scattered across every corner of Wei#Combat, long-range weapons#1|2#3001#

After founding the sect, Master Xi Yu continued to uphold the academy's core principle of benevolence, dispatching numerous disciples to teach widely and recruit extensively. Within the sect, there were no class distinctions, allowing many impoverished scholars to enroll and later achieve their ambitions by entering officialdom.

He preferred to live as a free spirit among the clouds and geese, roaming the mountains and rivers. On his travels, Chi Xunjian witnessed many civilians suffering from the ravages of war. While his long sword could drive off nefarious troublemakers, it was powerless in healing those wounded or afflicted by serious illness. Consequently, after these experiences, Chi Xunjian not only continued to refine his swordsmanship but also devoted considerable effort to researching alchemy and formulating elixirs. Eventually, he established a Sword Pavilion to ensure that his teachings—comprising both sword arts and the study of elixirs—could be passed down to others.#Sword#1|3#3003#

However, the law-abiding elders of Songshi Mountain had a disagreement with the contemporary sect leader regarding the transmission of Buddhism. As a result, they left Songshi Mountain to seek their own path, coincidentally at the time when the Salo style entered the inner regions. The law-abiding elders and others accepted the Salo lineage, traveled beyond the passes, and founded Great Snow Mountain, selecting disciples for transmission. Students of the Great Snow lineage were not allowed to learn or display their skills to others without initiation through ordination or formal teaching. This contributed greatly to its mystique. Due to the mysterious and remote location of Great Snow Mountain, as well as its lack of interest in participating in sect disputes, it remained intact regardless of how fierce the inner region's sectarian conflicts became.#Combat, long-range weapons#1|2#3003#
