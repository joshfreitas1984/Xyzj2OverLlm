200001#200#The Primordial Sword Sect#Gatehouse Details#The Primordial Sword Sect#The founder of the Primordial Sword Sect, Zhang Siguo, was once a disciple of the Daoist master Bai Wenqing. After Bai Wenqing's passing, Zhang Siguo established the Primordial Sword Sect. Due to its protection of many common people affected by war, it gained several disciples within the Yan Kingdom and became one of the earliest sects to emerge there. It witnessed the unifications among the seven states as well as the zeniths of Qi, Yan, and Chu. Later, with Emperor Jiahe's reverence for Daoism, many disciples from the Primordial Sword Sect had the opportunity to travel amongst nobles and even participate in some aristocratic struggles. Similarly, numerous noble families sent their children to study at the Primordial Sword Sect, enabling it to gradually become a leading sect within Daoism.##Later, Duan Chengjun believed that if everyone were obsessed with the Xuanmen and no one produced goods, it would lead to national calamity. He decided on a reform, which heavily impacted many Xuanmen sects; among them, the Danding lineage suffered greatly. However, the Primordial Sword Sect, due to its deep roots and greater emphasis on sword art and mind cultivation, quickly adjusted their management approach in response to the reforms, allowing their splendor to continue unabated.##Three hundred years later, after the plot to rebel was orchestrated by Emperor Zhan Wu failed and he was imprisoned, the vassal kings of the Yan Kingdom fell into chaos. After assessing the situation, the Primordial Sword Sect decided to support Prince Liang, which strengthened his faction's influence and enabled him to secure a voice within the imperial court. At the same time, Prince Liang held the Primordial Sword Sect in high regard, allowing it to maintain its position as the foremost among the Celestial Gate sects for another thousand years.##3011#Advantage#3#0###
