    translated: "The protagonist enters the Jianghu as a carefree young man lost in dreams. He becomes embroiled in the conflict between Fengfeng Luying Tower and Cangyin Hall within the Jianghu. During the dispute, you can choose to join either of these factions. Additionally, players have the opportunity to build their own small faction and join as an ally, starting from a humble beginning and growing into strength. Ultimately, they vie for supremacy in the Jianghu."
