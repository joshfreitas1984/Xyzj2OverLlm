    translated: "The protagonist enters the Jianghu as a young man lost in drunken dreams. In the Jianghu, he becomes entangled in a conflict between the Jiefeng Luoying Tower and the Juanxue Cangyin Tower. You can choose to join either faction's force during this dispute. Additionally, players have the option to form their own small force and enter as an ally, starting small and growing strong. Ultimately, they will vie for dominance in the Jianghu."
