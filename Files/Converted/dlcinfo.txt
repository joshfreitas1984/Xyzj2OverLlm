    translated: "The protagonist enters the Jianghu as a young man lost in his dreams. He becomes entangled in the conflict between the Stormwind Tower and the Snowy Mist Hidden Pavilion. During the dispute, you can choose to join either of the two forces. Additionally, players have the option to enter by building their own small force and growing it from modest beginnings to greater strength, ultimately vying for dominance over the Jianghu."
