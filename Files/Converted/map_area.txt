    translated: "Nestled among the serene mountains, surrounded by encircling peaks with lush greenery all around, the disciples of our martial sect must observe the rise and fall of tides, watch clouds unfurl and gather in their constant undulation. The mountain ridges stand like swords, soaring into the heavens. Under the starry skies, as day turns to night and countless days pass under the vast sky, they reflect one another's light in an endless cycle of change, forming a painting that seems endlessly repetitive yet infinitely varied. This cyclical process leads to the ultimate attainment of supreme spiritual power"

Beyond its gates, merchants call out, and in response, they come from all directions without ceasing. Within the villa, mountain streams converge, and the sound of flowing water echoes like jingling ornaments.\n\nLocated near the river and sea, the villa established itself as a commercial hub, developing its business into the largest family enterprise in Chu over time. For a century, it has protected the small merchants around it and is also well-regarded throughout the Jianghu"

Both literary and martial prowess are concealed in its vigor, and amidst smoke and flame, it is most akin to a place one longs to return to.

Pine and cypress trees guard its sacred form, as moss-covered steps are tread with reverence. Morning incense unfurls amidst ancient pines, deepening the sense of meditation; in the rustle of leaves, one hears echoes of martial arts practiced within bamboo groves. The Bodhi Mountain has witnessed countless seasons, yet the temple's shadow remains unshifted for a thousand years, bearing witness to numerous monks attaining enlightenment through Zen. It stands as a sacred site of Zen Buddhism"

At sunset, as the last rays of sunlight cast a golden hue, the sword peak appears as if rivaling the heavens in its stark grandeur. The fierce winds sweep through, swirling mist and clouds like drumbeats of battle. Amongst the rugged rocks, there stand lofty pines, standing tall with pride—much like the courageous members of Kuang Dao Men themselves. The pine branches sway gently, whispering ancient battle songs. This place lacks any semblance of softness but exudes a spirit of boldness and grandeur, truly a fitting domain for martial prowess."

As dusk falls and the sun sets, golden light bathes everything in its glow, making the Blade Peak appear as formidable as heaven itself. Harsh winds howl around, sweeping up swirling mists like drums of war, while jagged rocks rise ominously above.
