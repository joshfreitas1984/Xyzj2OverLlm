It creates a scenario where, upon achieving seven connected pieces, the stars shift and even celestial bodies cannot predict the outcome. It is said that there are two possible outcomes: one where Black is dead with no chance of revival, and the other where White lives eternally without dying. The rules of this chessboard are unique and mysterious, earning it the title The Ultimate Match in All Under Heaven."

    translated: "In April, the peach blossoms burst into full bloom, carried by the shore wind in a dance of petals filling the sky. Within Peach Blossom Harbor, tranquility and serenity reign. The water is clear with fish swimming beneath; cicadas chirp while birds sing harmoniously. Distant mountains appear as strokes of ink, nearby forests like clustered greenery. The unceasing murmur of flowing water reaches the ears, while singing birds fly past in a melody that captivates one's senses. High above Peach Blossom Harbor lies a secluded cave where, suddenly opening up, an astounding echo can be heard reverberating with thunderous sounds."

It cascades down, its mist drifting around as sunlight refracts through it, forming arcs of rainbow bridges. The sound of the waterfall is said to be akin to a dragon's roar, swirling through the valleys like an ancient Wulin melody played on a guqin. Surrounding the waterfall are verdant cypresses and bamboo, with cranes that perennially circle overhead, as if this place—a paradise where they dance alongside the Transforming Dragon Waterfall—is their own special haven."

Surrounding the waterfall are verdant cypresses and bamboo, with cranes that perennially circle overhead, as if this place—a paradise where they dance alongside the Transforming Dragon Waterfall—is their own special haven."

    translated: "Here, the river meanders like a giant dragon peering out, and the turbulent waters of the gorge stand in stark contrast to the tranquility of its banks. As we traveled, the steep cliffs loomed on both sides, with ancient, weathered rocks covered in patches of moss. Occasionally, one could spot some old inscriptions etched into them, recounting tales from generations of travelers past. When sunlight slants across the scene, golden beams dance upon the river's surface, transforming this area into a paradise-like realm."

    text: "坐落于楚国腹地，是一座历史悠久的江南名城。淮陵依水而建，四面环水，内有清溪贯穿，外护长江之威，自古便有“水绕淮陵”之美誉。城中古街石巷，楼台倒影于清澈的河水中，烟雨中的淮陵，更是如同一幅水墨画卷，美得令人心醉。"
    translated: "Located in the heartland of the Chu Kingdom, Huailing is an ancient and renowned city in Jiangnan. Built by the water, it is encircled on all sides by rivers, with a clear stream running through its center and protected externally by the majestic Yangtze River. From time immemorial, Huailing has been celebrated for being encircled by water, earning it great acclaim. The city's ancient streets and stone alleys, along with their mirrored reflections of pavilions in the crystal-clear river waters, make Huailing appear like a scroll painting crafted in ink and wash when shrouded in mist and rain—an enchanting sight that intoxicates the soul."

It secured control over key points: to the south guarding Huailing and to the north reaching Pinglu. The forces could advance across Spirit Gathering River or, if needed, retreat via Nine Luminaries Crossing downstream. With support from Mount Lu Academy and Universal Virtue Gate, they were prepared to resist the Yan Kingdom's Long Standard Army."
