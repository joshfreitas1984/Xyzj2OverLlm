The ambush began with an eruption from the central ridge of the Sisheng Peak and concluded when Zheng Liangji personally severed a stone pillar seven zhang in diameter. Ultimately, they secured victory over thirty million enemy troops with only three million men. This battle laid the foundation for the establishment of Yan and will be remembered through the ages"

To ensure the transmission of his own studies, he established a Sword Hall where he taught both his sword techniques and alchemy comprehensively. Once the Sword Hall developed a degree of stability, he resigned from his position as abbot and retired into seclusion in the mountains"

    translated: "The clear and refreshing stream meanders through rocks and forests, its gentle sounds stretching out. Tall pine trees and lush bamboo protect this tranquil corner of heaven and earth. Across the stepping stones over the flow, light smoke floats up with soft calls as stags sing early. Seeking seclusion and visiting scenic spots cleanses the spirit and removes worldly dust. Down at the waterfall, one often sees travelers leaning on railings to sing. This stream is not only renowned for its picturesque landscapes of clear mountains and beautiful waters but also attracts practitioners who come here to meditate and comprehend the ultimate principles of heaven and earth"
